#OS-Schedular
#This is project is implemented with C language for Operating System Course for college

#A CPU scheduler determines an order for the execution of its scheduled processes; it
decides which process will run according to a certain data structure that keeps track
of the processes in the system and their status.
A process, upon creation, has one of the three states: Running, Ready, Blocked (doing
I/O, using other resources than CPU or waiting on unavailable resource)

## headers.h contains clk functions, it should be included anywhere the clock functions are used.

## To get time call:

getClk();
